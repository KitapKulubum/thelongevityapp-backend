# Sleep Basics for Longevity

Sleep is one of the strongest predictors of healthspan and biological aging. Both short sleep (<6 hours) and long irregular sleep are associated with higher mortality, metabolic dysfunction, mood disorders, and impaired cognitive performance.

## Optimal Sleep Duration
- Most adults need between 7–9 hours of sleep per night.
- Consistency is as important as duration: going to bed and waking up at similar times strengthens the circadian rhythm.
- Sleeping before midnight is associated with deeper slow-wave sleep due to circadian melatonin timing.

## Circadian Rhythm & Light
- Morning daylight exposure within the first 60 minutes after waking supports cortisol rhythm and alertness.
- Bright light exposure after 21:00 delays melatonin secretion and disrupts sleep onset.
- Blue light from screens is especially disruptive in the evening.

## Sleep Architecture
- Deep sleep (slow-wave): physical recovery, immune function, growth hormone release.
- REM sleep: emotional processing, memory consolidation, creativity.
- Fragmented sleep reduces both deep and REM sleep even if total time in bed seems long.

## Common Sleep Disruptors
- Late caffeine intake (after 14:00–15:00)
- Late heavy meals
- Alcohol (may induce sleep but suppresses REM)
- Emotional stress and rumination
- Irregular sleep-wake schedule
- Excess screen time before bed

## Sleep & Metabolic Health
- Poor sleep increases insulin resistance and hunger hormones (ghrelin ↑, leptin ↓).
- Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to weight gain and visceral fat accumulation.
- Even one night of poor sleep can reduce glucose tolerance the next day.

## Practical Sleep Optimization Guidelines
- Wake up at the same time every day, including weekends.
- Get daylight exposure early.
- Stop caffeine at least 8 hours before bedtime.
- Avoid intense exercise in the last 2–3 hours before sleep.
- Create a “wind-down” routine: dim lights, warm shower, reading, breathing.
- Keep bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.
- Use the bed only for sleep and intimacy (no work, no scrolling).

## When to Be Cautious
- If a person has:
  - Chronic insomnia
  - Loud snoring with choking
  - Excessive daytime sleepiness
  - Frequent night awakenings with palpitations
  → medical evaluation is recommended to rule out sleep apnea or hormonal issues.

## Longevity Perspective
High-quality sleep is a cornerstone of:
- Mitochondrial function
- Hormonal balance
- Cognitive resilience
- Emotional regulation
- Immune system strength

Sleep is not a luxury. It is a biological requirement for long-term health and healthy aging.
